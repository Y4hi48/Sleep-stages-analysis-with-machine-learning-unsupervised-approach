%Key Paper for DMD in EEG Feature Extraction
The 2024 Communications Biology paper "Fast, accurate, and interpretable decoding of electrocorticographic signals using dynamic mode decomposition" directly supports using DMD for rapid EEG feature extraction. It demonstrates:

Speed: Conversion of DMD modes into spatial-DM (sDM) features reduces computational time by ~40% compared to kernel-based methods, enabling near-real-time applications.

Meaningful Features: sDM features outperform conventional power features in decoding accuracy (75.3% vs. 68.1% for hand movements) by capturing spatiotemporal coherence in high-γ bands.

Interpretability: sDM components correlate with neurophysiologically relevant patterns (e.g., sensorimotor activation during hand movements).

}      %

    Uses LSTM (a recurrent architecture) as the primary encoder.

    Incorporates a contrastive transformer module for self-supervised representation learning.

    Applies frequency-domain augmentation for unsupervised time series analysis.

    Validated on real-world datasets (human activity recognition, sleep stage classification).
